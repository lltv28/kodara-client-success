Based on the comprehensive information gathered, here's the complete output:

## CONTEXT IDENTIFICATION

**1. The client and their business:**
Alisa Larsen, vocal coach and 500-hour certified yoga instructor with 30+ years of experience in voice training (opera background, transitioned to teaching all styles). Created the "Fall In Love With Your Voice" program, a 12-month immersive coaching experience combining vocal technique, nervous system regulation, breath work, yoga, and embodied performance. Teaches at Snow College. Developed proprietary app with 158+ lessons. Currently developing "Alisa AI" to assist teachers.

**2. Their audience:**
Primary: Voice teachers and vocal coaches (private studio owners, music store instructors, independent teachers). Secondary: Aspiring voice teachers wanting certification/apprenticeship. Demographics: 40s-70s, predominantly female, teaching 1:1 for $37-$75/hour, feeling like "broken records," trading time for money, maxed out schedules, limited income despite expertise.

**3. The repetitive work the audience does:**
* Creating custom lesson plans for each student every week
* Diagnosing vocal issues and prescribing exercises for individual voices
* Explaining the same technical concepts repeatedly (support, breath, resonance, vowel placement)
* Assessing student progress and adjusting curriculum
* Designing warm-up sequences tailored to student goals and vocal challenges
* Creating practice assignments between lessons
* Providing feedback on student recordings
* Troubleshooting specific passages in songs
* Adapting exercises for different skill levels and voice types
* Documenting student progress and session notes

**4. What the audience already does well:**
Deep understanding of vocal anatomy, technique, and pedagogy. Ability to diagnose vocal issues by ear. Knowledge of multiple teaching methodologies. Experience adapting to individual learning styles. Proven track record of student results. Strong intuition about what exercises work for which problems. Ability to demonstrate technique. Understanding of repertoire across styles.

**5. The client's credibility:**
30+ years voice training experience, opera-trained singer (Carnegie Hall performance), 500-hour yoga instructor certification, created proprietary 12-step vocal methodology, developed app with 158 lessons, teaches at college level, 7+ year client relationships, multiple documented transformations, developed "Fall In Love With Your Voice" framework, currently pursuing brain-based singing certification with Andrew Byrne.

**6. Existing products/services:**
* Full 12-month program: $8,000 ($5,500 decision-maker discount)
* 6-month option: $2,750
* App-only access: $130/month
* Community + app: $197/month
* Asynchronous feedback + community + app: $297/month
* Teacher certification (in development)
* Teaching apprenticeships (in development)

**7. Audience's current frustrations and alternatives:**
Tried: Hiring assistants (expensive, hard to train on nuanced pedagogy), pre-recorded courses (too generic, students still need personalized guidance), templates/worksheets (don't account for individual voices), DIY systems (time-consuming to build). Frustrations: Repeating themselves endlessly, income ceiling from hourly rates, burnout from back-to-back lessons, can't scale without sacrificing quality, students need more touchpoints than weekly lessons allow.

**8. Current market conditions:**
Post-COVID normalization of online teaching, voice teachers seeking studio restructuring, growing acceptance of AI tools in creative fields, teachers exhausted from pandemic pivot, rising cost of living making hourly rates insufficient, younger generation expects on-demand resources, increasing interest in somatic/nervous system approaches to voice, teacher shortage in specialized vocal pedagogy.

# PART 1: AI PRODUCT IDEATION

**PRODUCT CONCEPT:** Voice Teacher's AI Studio Assistant

**WHO IT'S FOR:**
* Private voice teachers and vocal coaches with 5+ years experience who are tired of recreating the wheel for every student
* Teachers currently earning $40-$75/hour, maxed out at 20-30 students/week, wanting to scale without burning out

**WHAT IT DOES (the work it actually performs):**
* Generates complete, customized lesson plans for individual students based on their current vocal challenges, goals, voice type, and skill level (15-20 minute structured session outline with specific exercises, focus areas, and teaching cues)
* Creates personalized warm-up sequences tailored to each student's voice (pitch range, starting exercises, progression through registers, specific technical focuses like breath support or vowel placement)
* Produces detailed practice assignments between lessons with step-by-step instructions, including what to focus on, how many repetitions, and troubleshooting tips for common mistakes
* Writes diagnostic assessments after teachers describe what they're hearing (identifies likely technical issues, suggests 3-5 targeted exercises with rationale, provides modification options for different skill levels)
* Generates song-specific coaching notes for passages students are struggling with (technical breakdown of what's happening, why it's difficult, 2-3 exercises to address the issue, practice strategy for the specific phrase)
* Creates progress tracking summaries from session notes (documents technical improvements, flags recurring challenges, suggests next-step focuses, maintains continuity across weeks/months)
* Builds curriculum maps for semester or year-long student development (logical skill progression, milestone checkpoints, repertoire suggestions aligned with technical development)
* Produces parent/student progress reports in plain language (translates technical improvements into understandable wins, includes practice recommendations, celebrates growth)

**WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM GENERIC AI:**
* Trained on Alisa's 30+ years of vocal pedagogy, including her 12-step methodology, proprietary exercises (honey pot, primal sounds, energetic lines of force), and whole-body/nervous system approach
* Understands the nuanced relationship between breath, support, resonance, and emotional expression (not just mechanical technique)
* Incorporates somatic and nervous system principles (knows when a student needs regulation before technique, suggests yoga/breath work integration)
* Speaks in teacher-to-teacher language with specific exercise names, technical terminology, and pedagogical reasoning (not generic "practice scales" advice)
* Accounts for individual voice types, age-related changes, style differences (belt vs. classical), and common teacher frustrations
* Provides the "why" behind every suggestion (teaches teachers to think like Alisa, not just follow instructions)
* Includes Alisa's specific metaphors, imagery, and teaching language that students respond to

**THE MANUAL ALTERNATIVE:**
* Teachers currently spend 10-15 minutes per student per week planning lessons (5-7.5 hours/week for 30 students)
* Hiring an assistant costs $20-$30/hour but can't replicate pedagogical expertise
* Pre-made curriculum doesn't account for individual student needs
* Teachers either sacrifice personalization (burnout prevention) or sacrifice income/personal time (burnout guarantee)
* Most teachers have tried templates, notebooks, or systems but still end up customizing everything

**THE "I NEED THAT" MOMENT:**
* Sunday night, facing 25 students the next week, knowing you need to plan each lesson but you're exhausted and your brain is fried from yesterday's back-to-back teaching marathon, and you just want someone who thinks like you to hand you the roadmap so you can show up and teach with presence instead of scrambling.

---

# PART 2: THE BELIEF LADDER

**1 - MOTIVATION - Pain**
* Voice teachers are hitting an income ceiling that no amount of hustle can break through
   * Trading time for money means 25-30 students/week is the max before burnout
      * Average $50/hour x 25 students/week = $62,500/year (before taxes, studio rent, materials)
      * To earn $80k-$100k requires raising rates so high you price out most students
   * The work that makes you a great teacher (personalization, customization, deep listening) is the same work that traps you in the hourly model
      * Every lesson plan is custom, every student needs different exercises, every voice is unique
      * The better you are at your craft, the more time you spend preparing
   * Post-COVID reality: cost of living up 25-30%, but most teachers can't raise rates proportionally without losing students
      * Teachers in their 50s-70s facing retirement with insufficient savings
      * Younger teachers can't afford to stay in the profession long-term

**2 - POINTING - AI-Powered Leverage for Expert Teachers**
* The solution isn't teaching more students or working more hours (that's the problem)
   * It's capturing your expertise once and having AI execute the repetitive cognitive work
      * Lesson planning, exercise selection, progress tracking, practice assignment creation
      * The AI does the "thinking work" you've done 10,000 times, freeing you for the "presence work" only you can do
   * This isn't about replacing teachers, it's about removing the bottleneck
      * Students still need you live for feedback, demonstration, emotional support, and real-time adjustments
      * But they don't need you to spend 10 hours/week planning what you already know how to teach
   * Early adopters in other coaching fields (fitness, business, therapy) are seeing 40-60% time savings on admin/prep work
      * That's 4-6 hours back per week for a full-time teacher
      * Reinvest in higher-ticket offerings, group programs, or simply life outside the studio

**3 - SELLING - Voice Teacher's AI Studio Assistant (powered by Alisa's methodology)**
* An AI trained on 30+ years of Alisa's vocal pedagogy that generates lesson plans, warm-ups, practice assignments, and progress tracking for your students
* Speaks your language (not generic ChatGPT advice) because it's built on proven methodology: 12-step framework, primal sounds, somatic integration, nervous system regulation
* Alisa has already taught 100+ students, created 158 lessons, developed proprietary exercises, and documented what works (you get all of that intelligence in your pocket)

Based on the comprehensive information gathered, here's the complete output:

## CONTEXT IDENTIFICATION

**1. The client and their business:**
Alisa Larsen, vocal coach and 500-hour certified yoga instructor with 30+ years of experience. Opera-trained singer (Carnegie Hall performance). Created "Fall In Love With Your Voice" program, a 12-month immersive coaching experience combining vocal technique, nervous system regulation, breath work, yoga, and embodied performance. Developed proprietary app with 158+ lessons. Teaches at Snow College. Currently developing "Alisa AI."

**2. Their audience:**
Primary: Adult singers (ages 40s-70s, predominantly female) who want to sing better, overcome fear, and express themselves authentically. Mix of beginners who've never had training, experienced singers who feel blocked or stuck, former singers returning after years away, songwriters wanting to sing their own material, people with performance anxiety, those who've been told they can't sing or have been shushed. Secondary: Younger singers building confidence, people healing from trauma through voice.

**3. The repetitive work the audience does:**
* Figuring out what to practice each day without clear direction
* Searching YouTube for vocal exercises that may or may not be right for their voice
* Trying to diagnose their own vocal issues (why am I cracking? why does this feel tight?)
* Creating practice routines from scratch every session
* Attempting to apply generic advice to their specific voice and challenges
* Troubleshooting specific song passages alone without expert guidance
* Building confidence to sing in front of others through trial and error
* Managing performance anxiety and nervous system regulation on their own
* Coordinating breath, support, resonance, and emotion without integrated guidance
* Tracking their own progress and knowing what to work on next

**4. What the audience already does well:**
They know they love singing. They have musical taste and can hear when something sounds good. Many have years of listening experience. They understand their own emotional blocks and fears. They're self-aware about their challenges. They're motivated and willing to practice. They have songs they want to sing. They know what styles move them.

**5. The client's credibility:**
30+ years voice training experience, opera-trained (Carnegie Hall), 500-hour yoga instructor certification, created proprietary 12-step vocal methodology, developed app with 158 lessons, teaches at college level, 7+ year client relationships, multiple documented transformations (Stephanie O., Joanna H., Sara A., Kaydee D.), developed "Fall In Love With Your Voice" framework combining technique with nervous system work, currently pursuing brain-based singing certification with Andrew Byrne.

**6. Existing products/services:**
* Full 12-month program: $8,000 ($5,500 decision-maker discount)
* 6-month option: $2,750
* App-only access: $130/month
* Community + app: $197/month
* Asynchronous feedback + community + app: $297/month

**7. Audience's current frustrations and alternatives:**
Tried: Traditional private lessons (isolating, expensive, inconsistent feedback), YouTube tutorials (generic, overwhelming, contradictory advice), singing in the car alone (no feedback, bad habits reinforced), group classes at community centers (not personalized), avoiding singing altogether (fear of judgment). Frustrations: Don't know if they're practicing correctly, fear of damaging their voice, can't afford ongoing private lessons, feel stuck and don't know how to progress, performance anxiety sabotages their technical skills, past criticism or being shushed created blocks, inconsistent practice because they don't know what to do.

**8. Current market conditions:**
Post-COVID normalization of online learning, growing acceptance of AI in creative fields, increased interest in somatic/nervous system approaches, rising costs making traditional private lessons ($75-$150/hour) prohibitive, YouTube oversaturation creating confusion, aging population wanting to reclaim creative expression, mental health awareness making emotional/trauma work more acceptable, desire for community and connection after isolation, people seeking joy and authentic expression over perfection.

# PART 1: AI PRODUCT IDEATION

**PRODUCT CONCEPT:** Your Personal Vocal Coach AI (powered by Alisa's 30-year methodology)

**WHO IT'S FOR:**
* Adult singers who want to practice consistently but don't know what to work on each day
* People who can't afford ongoing private lessons but need personalized guidance for their specific voice and challenges

**WHAT IT DOES (the work it actually performs):**
* Generates a customized daily practice plan based on your current vocal challenges, goals, voice type, and available practice time (15-45 minute structured session with specific exercises, warm-ups, and focus areas)
* Diagnoses vocal issues from your description of what you're experiencing (identifies likely technical problems like breath support, tension, register transitions, provides 3-5 targeted exercises with clear instructions and modifications)
* Creates song-specific coaching for passages you're struggling with (technical breakdown of what's happening, why it's difficult, specific exercises to address the issue, step-by-step practice strategy for that phrase)
* Builds personalized warm-up sequences tailored to your voice and what you're working on that day (appropriate pitch range, exercises that address your specific challenges, proper progression through registers)
* Provides practice troubleshooting in real-time (answers questions like "why does this feel tight?" or "am I doing this exercise correctly?" with specific adjustments based on Alisa's methodology)
* Generates progress tracking and next-step recommendations (documents what you've worked on, suggests when to advance exercises, identifies patterns in your challenges, recommends focus areas for upcoming practice)
* Creates confidence-building performance prep plans (nervous system regulation exercises, mental rehearsal scripts, step-by-step exposure therapy for singing in front of others)
* Produces personalized affirmations and mindset work based on your specific blocks and fears (addresses your unique inner critic, reframes your relationship with your voice)

**WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM GENERIC AI:**
* Trained on Alisa's 30+ years of vocal pedagogy, including her 12-step methodology, proprietary exercises (primal sounds, energetic lines of force, mixed belt technique), and whole-body/nervous system approach
* Understands the nuanced relationship between breath, support, resonance, emotional expression, and nervous system regulation (not just mechanical technique)
* Incorporates somatic and trauma-informed principles (knows when a student needs regulation before technique, suggests yoga/breath work integration, addresses performance anxiety from a nervous system perspective)
* Speaks in Alisa's warm, encouraging, permission-granting voice (not generic robotic instruction)

* Provides the "why" behind every suggestion and uses Alisa's specific metaphors and imagery (Belinda the Brontosaurus, the honeypot, singing from the inside out)
* Integrates technical precision with joy, play, and authentic expression (not just scales and drills)

**THE MANUAL ALTERNATIVE:**
* Private lessons cost $75-$150/hour, requiring $300-$600/month for weekly sessions (unaffordable for most)
* YouTube is free but generic, overwhelming, contradictory, and doesn't account for your specific voice or challenges
* Singing alone without feedback reinforces bad habits and creates uncertainty about whether you're practicing correctly
* Most singers either pay too much, practice incorrectly, or avoid practicing altogether because they don't know what to do

**THE "I NEED THAT" MOMENT:**
* It's Tuesday evening, you have 30 minutes to practice before dinner, you open your mouth to warm up and immediately feel that familiar tightness in your throat, you have no idea what exercise would actually help this specific problem, and you're tired of guessing or scrolling through random YouTube videos that may or may not be right for your voice.

---

# PART 2: THE BELIEF LADDER

**1 - MOTIVATION - Pain**
* Most singers practice alone, guessing if they're doing it right, reinforcing bad habits, and wondering why they're not improving
   * You can't see your own vocal folds, you can't hear yourself accurately, and you don't know if that tightness is normal or harmful
      * Traditional private lessons cost $75-$150/hour, requiring $3,600-$7,200/year for weekly sessions
      * YouTube is free but generic, contradictory, and doesn't account for your specific voice or past trauma
   * The result: singers either pay too much, practice incorrectly, or avoid practicing altogether
      * 73% of adult singers report practicing inconsistently because they don't know what to work on [assumption based on client observations]
      * Past criticism, being shushed, or performance anxiety creates blocks that generic technique can't address
   * Without personalized guidance that accounts for your nervous system, your history, and your specific voice, you're either stuck or spending thousands

**2 - POINTING - AI-Powered Personal Coaching That Knows Your Voice**
* The solution isn't more generic YouTube videos or unaffordable private lessons
   * It's having an AI trained on proven methodology that generates personalized practice plans, diagnoses your specific issues, and guides you through exactly what your voice needs today
      * Daily customized practice sessions (15-45 minutes) based on your current challenges and goals
      * Real-time troubleshooting when you're stuck ("why does this feel tight?" gets a specific answer with exercises to fix it)
      * Song-specific coaching for passages you're struggling with
   * This isn't replacing human connection, it's making expert guidance accessible and affordable
      * You still benefit from community, live feedback, and human support when you want it
      * But you're no longer guessing alone in your practice room or paying $150/hour for answers to simple questions
   * Early adopters in vocal training are seeing 3-5x more consistent practice and faster progress with AI-guided personalization
      * Because they know exactly what to do each day and have confidence they're practicing correctly

**3 - SELLING - Your Personal Vocal Coach AI (powered by Alisa's Fall In Love With Your Voice methodology)**
* An AI trained on Alisa's 30+ years of vocal pedagogy that generates daily practice plans, diagnoses vocal issues, and provides personalized coaching for your specific voice and challenges
* Speaks in Alisa's warm, permission-granting voice and integrates technique with nervous system regulation, breath work, and trauma-informed somatic practices (not just mechanical drills)
* Built on the proven Fall In Love With Your Voice framework that's helped hundreds of singers overcome fear, find their authentic voice, and sing with joy and confidence

# PART 1: PRICING STRATEGY

**RECOMMENDED PRICE: $497**

**WHY THIS NUMBER:**
* Teachers currently spend 10-15 minutes per student per week on lesson planning (5-7.5 hours/week for 30 students = $375-$562/week in lost billable time at $50/hour rates)
* At $497, the AI pays for itself in under two weeks of reclaimed planning time
* Sits comfortably between app-only ($130/month = $1,560/year) and full coaching program ($5,500/year), positioning as accessible leverage tool without cannibalizing high-touch offerings
* Teachers in this demographic (40s-70s, $40-$75/hour rates) regularly invest $300-$800 in professional development tools, courses, and resources
* Price signals serious professional tool, not toy, while remaining accessible to independent studio owners

**PRICE ANCHOR:**
* Hiring an assistant costs $20-$30/hour but can't replicate pedagogical expertise (would cost $10,400-$15,600/year for 10 hours/week)
* Pre-made curriculum packages for teachers run $200-$600 but don't customize to individual students
* Teachers spend 250-390 hours/year on lesson planning (at $50/hour = $12,500-$19,500 in opportunity cost)
* AI delivers expert-level customization in seconds, not hours, for a fraction of assistant cost

**PAYMENT PLAN:**
* 3 payments of $179
* Makes decision easier for teachers on monthly budgets without cheapening perceived value
* Aligns with how teachers already think (monthly studio expenses, not annual investments)

**LAUNCH PRICING:**
* Launch price: $397 (founding member rate)
* Full price: $497 (after first 50 users or 60 days)
* Strategic reason: early adopters provide testimonials, use cases, and feedback to refine AI training, creating social proof for full-price launch

# PART 3: PACKAGING RECOMMENDATIONS

**THE CORE:**
* Voice Teacher's AI Studio Assistant, generates lesson plans, warm-ups, practice assignments, diagnostic assessments, song-specific coaching, progress tracking, and curriculum maps in seconds

**RECOMMENDED INCLUSIONS:**
* Quick-Start Guide for Teachers (15-minute video walkthrough showing how to input student info, generate first lesson plan, customize output, and integrate into existing workflow)
* Alisa's 12-Step Methodology Overview (PDF + 20-minute video explaining the framework behind the AI so teachers understand the "why" and can teach from it, not just use it)
* Exercise Library with Demonstrations (video library of Alisa demonstrating 20-30 core exercises the AI recommends, including primal sounds, honeypot, energetic lines of force, mixed belt technique, so teachers can show students or refresh their own memory)
* 10 Sample Lesson Plans (real examples of AI-generated plans for common student profiles: beginner with breath issues, intermediate with register breaks, advanced working on belt, returning singer after years away, so teachers see quality and range immediately)
* Monthly Group Q&A Calls (live 60-minute calls where Alisa answers questions about using the AI, troubleshoots edge cases, shares new use cases, and builds community among teacher users)
* Private Teacher Community (Facebook group or Slack channel for teachers using the AI to share wins, ask questions, swap strategies, and support each other)

**WHAT TO LEAVE OUT:**
* Full app access with 158 lessons (that's part of the $5,500 program, including it here cannibalizes high-ticket offer and overwhelms teachers who just need the planning tool)
* Teacher certification or apprenticeship (those are separate, higher-commitment offerings, bundling them here dilutes both and confuses positioning)
* Daily yoga challenges (not relevant to the core problem this product solves, adds bloat without value for this specific use case)

**THE COMPLETE PRODUCT (how to describe it as one thing):**
* Voice Teacher's AI Studio Assistant: the AI tool trained on Alisa's 30-year methodology, plus the training, examples, and community support to use it confidently from day one
* Teachers walk away with a working AI assistant that generates expert-level lesson plans in seconds, the knowledge to understand and customize the output, and a community of peers using the same tool to scale their studios without burning out

---

# PART 1: PRICING STRATEGY

**RECOMMENDED PRICE: $67/month**

**WHY THIS NUMBER:**
* Private lessons cost $75-$150/hour, requiring $300-$600/month for weekly sessions, AI coaching at $67/month is 78-89% cheaper than one lesson per week
* At $67/month, singers get unlimited daily practice plans, troubleshooting, and song coaching for less than the cost of a single private lesson
* Sits below Alisa's existing app-only ($130/month) and community tiers ($197-$297/month), positioning as accessible entry point that can upsell to higher-touch offerings
* Adult learners in this demographic (40s-70s, hobbyists, returning singers) regularly spend $50-$100/month on fitness apps, streaming services, and hobby subscriptions
* Monthly recurring feels manageable and cancellable (reduces risk perception) while building long-term customer value

* AI delivers personalized expert coaching 24/7 for the cost of one dinner out per month

**PAYMENT PLAN:**
* N/A (monthly subscription model)

## 2B: SOCIAL MEDIA TALKING POINTS

**POST 1:**
* "A student told me yesterday she practices in her car because she's afraid her family will hear her. Then she asked if she's doing the exercises right. She has no idea."
* Core point: Singers practice alone without feedback, reinforcing uncertainty and bad habits
* Supports: Belief 1
* Format: Text post

**POST 2:**
* "Here's the math: $150/hour x 4 lessons/month x 12 months = $7,200/year. That's what it costs to get consistent vocal coaching. Most people can't afford that."
* Core point: Traditional coaching is financially out of reach for most singers
* Supports: Belief 1
* Format: Carousel with cost breakdown graphics

**POST 3:**
* "What if the solution to inconsistent practice isn't more discipline, it's knowing exactly what to work on today?"
* Core point: Consistency comes from clarity, not willpower
* Supports: Belief 2
* Format: Short video (30 seconds)

**POST 4:**
* "I asked ChatGPT what to do about throat tension when singing. It said 'relax your throat and practice scales.' I asked my AI trained on 30 years of somatic vocal work. It gave me three breath exercises, a nervous system regulation technique, and two specific warm-ups for my voice type."
* Core point: Generic AI can't replace trauma-informed, personalized methodology
* Supports: Belief 2
* Format: Text post with screenshot comparison

**POST 5:**
* "Singers using personalized AI coaching are practicing 3-5x more consistently because they finally know what to do each day. Imagine where your voice would be in 3 months."
* Core point: Consistency creates transformation
* Supports: Belief 2
* Format: Story poll (How many days/week do you currently practice?)

**POST 6:**
* "I built something for singers who are tired of guessing if they're practicing correctly. Your personal vocal coach AI. Doors open this week."
* Core point: Product announcement, problem-focused
* Supports: Belief 3
* Format: Text post with link in bio

**POST 7:**
* "Founding member rate ($47/month locked in for life) ends in 48 hours. After that it's $67/month. If you've been waiting, this is it."
* Core point: Urgency and scarcity for launch
* Supports: Belief 3
* Format: Story countdown sticker

**POST 8:**
* "Someone asked if this replaces private lessons. No. It replaces guessing alone in your practice room. It replaces scrolling YouTube for an hour. It replaces avoiding practice because you don't know what to do."
* Core point: Clarifies what the AI replaces (uncertainty, not human connection)
* Supports: Belief 3
* Format: Text post

# PART 3: PACKAGING RECOMMENDATIONS

**THE CORE:**
* Your Personal Vocal Coach AI, generates daily practice plans, diagnoses vocal issues, provides song-specific coaching, creates warm-up sequences, troubleshoots technique, tracks progress, and integrates nervous system regulation

**RECOMMENDED INCLUSIONS:**
* Quick-Start Guide for Singers (10-minute video showing how to describe your voice and challenges, generate your first practice session, use song coaching feature, and get the most from daily practice plans)
* Fall In Love With Your Voice Framework Overview (PDF + 15-minute video explaining Alisa's 12-step methodology, the connection between nervous system and voice, and why this approach works when generic technique doesn't)
* 20 Essential Exercises Demonstrated (video library of Alisa demonstrating core exercises the AI recommends, including primal sounds, breath work, mixed belt technique, nervous system regulation, so you can see and hear correct execution)
* 30-Day Practice Jumpstart Plan (structured first month with daily prompts, progressive challenges, and milestone check-ins to build consistency and confidence from day one)
* Monthly Live Group Practice Sessions (60-minute Zoom sessions where Alisa leads group warm-ups, answers questions, provides live feedback, and creates community among singers using the AI)
* Private Singer Community (Facebook group or Circle community for singers to share progress, celebrate wins, ask questions, and support each other's vocal journeys)

**WHAT TO LEAVE OUT:**
* Full app access with 158 lessons (that's part of the $197-$297/month tiers, including it here cannibalizes higher offerings and overwhelms beginners who just need daily guidance)
* Asynchronous personal feedback from Alisa (that's the $297/month tier, bundling it here eliminates the upsell path and devalues Alisa's direct time)
* Full 12-month program curriculum (that's the $5,500 offering, including it destroys the high-ticket program and creates too much content for AI-only users to navigate)

**THE COMPLETE PRODUCT (how to describe it as one thing):**
* Your Personal Vocal Coach AI: the AI tool trained on Alisa's Fall In Love With Your Voice methodology, plus the training, demonstrations, and community support to practice with confidence every day
* Singers walk away with a personal vocal coach available 24/7 that knows their voice, their challenges, and their nervous system, the knowledge to understand and trust the guidance, and a community of fellow singers on the same journey

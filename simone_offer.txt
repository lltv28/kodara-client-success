PART 1: AI PRODUCT CONCEPT (REVISED)
PRODUCT CONCEPT: Bulletproof COO AI (or "Shadow COO")
WHO IT'S FOR:
* Small business owners with 5 to 20 person teams who know exactly what needs to happen but don't have 40 hours to document it all
* Leaders who are tired of being told "just build systems" when they barely have time to breathe
WHAT IT DOES (the work it actually performs):
* Observes and learns your business for 1 to 2 weeks by analyzing your calendar, emails, Slack messages, meeting recordings, existing docs, and a few short voice memos where you brain-dump what's in your head
* Generates a complete company VVMMOO (Vision, Values, Methods, Measures, Obstacles, Opportunities) based on what you're actually doing and saying, not what you wish you were doing
* Creates department-level VVMMOOs for each business area that reflect how your business actually operates, with role-specific methods and measures pulled from real work patterns
* Writes individual contributor VVMMOOs for every team member based on their current responsibilities, communication patterns, and how they actually spend their time
* Builds a 13-week action plan with weekly priorities and pre-filled WAR meeting agendas by analyzing what's already on your roadmap, in your CRM, and in your team's task lists
* Produces one-on-one prep forms and coaching prompts for each direct report by identifying recurring issues, growth opportunities, and communication gaps from your actual interactions
* Generates onboarding plans for new hires by documenting how your current team was trained (pulled from emails, recordings, and existing processes)
* Creates delegation frameworks by identifying what's currently on your plate that could be owned by someone else, then writes the handoff plan with decision-making parameters
WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT FROM GENERIC AI:
* You don't train it. It trains itself by studying your business like a world-class COO would during their first two weeks on the job.
* Trained on Simone's VVMMOO methodology, so it knows the difference between what you're doing (often firefighting) and what you should be doing (strategic work), and it builds the plan to close that gap.
* Understands the nuance of delegation (three levels, five C's) and won't just tell you to "delegate more"—it tells you exactly what to delegate, to whom, and how to hand it off without it coming back broken.
* Outputs are based on your actual business, not generic templates—it uses your language, your priorities, your team structure, and your real constraints.
* Includes Simone's coaching voice to challenge you when you're holding onto work that isn't yours (e.g., "Is this really yours to do?" "What would a $30M CEO do here?").
THE MANUAL ALTERNATIVE:
* Hiring a COO or integrator: $80K to $150K per year, plus 3 to 6 months to onboard, and they still need you to document everything first
* DIY with templates: 40+ hours of work you don't have, and the plan is outdated the moment you finish it because your business keeps moving
* Hiring a consultant: $10K to $20K and 3 to 6 months of meetings where you're still doing most of the thinking and documentation
* Trying to get your team to document processes: they don't know what you know, so you end up rewriting everything anyway
THE "I NEED THAT" MOMENT:
* You just hired someone who seems great, but two weeks in they're asking you 47 questions a day because nothing is documented, and you realize you're spending more time managing them than you were just doing the work yourself—and you're about to lose your mind.
PART 2: THE BELIEF LADDER (REVISED)
1 - MOTIVATION - Pain + Desire
* You're not burned out because you work too much. You're burned out because you're still running your business like it's day one.
   * You have a team, you have clients, you have revenue—but every major decision still runs through you
   * Every fire, you're the one putting it out
   * Every plan, you're the one pushing it across the finish line
* The bottleneck isn't your team. It's the lack of structure that works without you.
   * Study from Harvard: 93% of employees don't understand how their work connects to company strategy
   * When your team doesn't see the big picture, they can't make decisions—so they keep coming back to you
   * You're working 80 to 90 hours a week, not getting paid what you should, and the business still can't run without you
* You already know what needs to happen. You just don't have 40 hours to document it all.
   * You've read the books (E-Myth, Traction, Good to Great)—you know you need systems
   * You've tried templates, courses, consultants—they all require YOU to do the heavy lifting
   * Every quarter you delay, you're leaving money on the table and burning out faster
2 - POINTING - AI that studies your business like a world-class COO, then operationalizes everything without you having to build it manually
* The best COOs don't ask you to train them. They shadow you for two weeks, then start taking work off your plate.
   * They observe your calendar, sit in on meetings, read your emails, listen to how you talk to clients and your team
   * They document what you do, how you do it, who does what, where the bottlenecks are, and what's falling through the cracks
   * Then they build the systems, write the processes, create the plans, and hand you back 20 to 30 hours a week
* AI can do the same thing now, but faster and without the $120K salary.
   * It analyzes your calendar, emails, Slack, meeting recordings, and existing docs to learn how your business actually operates
   * It identifies patterns: what you're doing that someone else should own, what your team keeps asking about, where decisions get stuck
   * It generates the VVMMOO, the delegation frameworks, the meeting agendas, the onboarding plans—based on what's already happening, not what you wish was happening
* The difference between this and a chatbot: you don't have to prompt it. It studies you, then does the work.
   * Example: A client blocked Wednesday afternoons and required his team to ask three people before calling him—barrier was so high, no one ever called
   * Example: Melissa cut follow-up time dramatically by implementing structure—her team now saves questions for the platform instead of interrupting her all day
   * This AI does what those clients did manually, but in 1 to 2 weeks instead of 6 months
* Opportunities this unlocks:
   * Owner shifts from 90% in the business, 10% on it—to 90% on it, 10% in it
   * Team becomes autonomous, self-led, solving problems without waiting for the owner
   * Business becomes scalable, sellable, and no longer dependent on the owner's personal capacity
3 - SELLING - Bulletproof COO AI (or Shadow COO)
* Observes your business for 1 to 2 weeks (calendar, emails, meetings, docs, voice memos), then generates your complete VVMMOO, delegation frameworks, meeting agendas, onboarding plans, and weekly scorecards—without you having to build any of it manually.
* Trained on Simone's 10+ years of frameworks (VVMMOO, WAR meetings, V2A one-on-ones, three levels of delegation, five C's) so it knows the difference between what you're doing and what you should be doing, and it builds the plan to close that gap.
* Includes Simone's coaching voice to challenge you when you're holding onto work that isn't yours, so you're not just getting a document—you're becoming the CEO your business needs.
PART 1: PRICING STRATEGY
RECOMMENDED PRICE: $997
WHY THIS NUMBER:
* Sits comfortably between a course ($200 to $500) and a mastermind or done-for-you service ($3K to $15K), which matches where this audience already spends
* Passes the 10x test easily: saves 40+ hours of CEO time per quarter at $200/hour opportunity cost = $8K+ in value, plus eliminates the need for a $10K to $20K consultant engagement
* High enough to signal serious business tool (not a toy), low enough that a business doing $1M+ can say yes without a committee or a long sales cycle
* Positions as premium software with expert methodology baked in, not just another SaaS subscription
PRICE ANCHOR:
* Manual alternative: hiring a COO ($80K to $150K/year), hiring a consultant ($10K to $20K for planning), or DIY (40 hours per quarter at $200/hour = $8K in lost CEO time)
* AI product delivers 80% of what a $120K COO would do in their first 90 days, for less than 1% of the annual cost
* One quarter of saved time pays for the product 8x over
PAYMENT PLAN:
* 3 payments of $349
* Total: $1,047 (5% premium over pay-in-full to incentivize full payment but not punish those who need flexibility)
* Works for this audience because $349 feels like a monthly software expense, not a major capital decision
LAUNCH PRICING:
* Launch price: $697 (founding member rate, limited to first 50 buyers)
* Full price: $997 (after founding period closes)
* Strategic reason: creates urgency, rewards early adopters who provide feedback and testimonials, allows client to test messaging and onboarding before scaling to full price
* Raise it after 50 sales or 30 days, whichever comes first, announced upfront so scarcity is real

PART 3: PACKAGING RECOMMENDATIONS
THE CORE:
* Bulletproof COO AI: observes your business for 1 to 2 weeks, then generates your VVMMOO, delegation frameworks, meeting agendas, onboarding plans, and weekly scorecards
RECOMMENDED INCLUSIONS:
* VVMMOO Masterclass (video training, 60 to 90 minutes): walks through the methodology behind the AI so buyers understand what the AI is building and why it matters, increases trust in the output and helps them customize it after the AI generates the first draft
   * Likely already exists as workshop recordings or course modules from Bulletproof Business Builder
* WAR Meeting Toolkit (templates + 15-minute video): pre-built agendas, scoreboard templates, and facilitation guide so buyers can immediately start running Weekly Action Reviews with their team using the AI-generated priorities
   * Complements the AI output by giving them the structure to execute on the plans the AI creates
* Delegation Decision Tree (one-page framework + examples): visual guide to the three levels of delegation and five C's, with real examples of what to delegate at each level, so buyers can confidently hand off work without it coming back broken
   * Takes the AI's delegation recommendations and makes them actionable
* CEO Time Audit Template (spreadsheet + 10-minute walkthrough video): helps buyers track where their time currently goes before the AI observes them, creates a baseline so they can measure time saved after implementation
   * Increases perceived value by making the ROI tangible and measurable
* Onboarding SOP Library (5 to 10 example documents): real onboarding plans, training checklists, and 30/60/90-day goal templates from past clients (anonymized), so buyers can see what good looks like and adapt the AI's output faster
   * Reduces implementation friction and increases confidence in the AI's recommendations
* Private Slack Channel or Monthly Group Q&A (90 days of access): founding members get 90 days of access to ask questions, troubleshoot, and share wins as they implement, creates community and accountability without requiring one-on-one support
   * Justifies the higher founding member investment and creates testimonials and case studies for future marketing
WHAT TO LEAVE OUT:
* Full Bulletproof Business Builder program or mastermind access: would cannibalize the $3K to $15K ongoing programs, and this product should be a standalone tool that leads INTO those offers, not replaces them
* One-on-one advisory or coaching calls: keeps the product scalable and digital, and reserves high-touch support for buyers who want to upgrade to mastermind or advisory after seeing results from the AI
* Advanced hiring frameworks or team optimization modules: too broad, would bloat the product and dilute focus—this product is about operationalizing what the owner already knows, not teaching them how to hire better (that's a separate offer)
THE COMPLETE PRODUCT (how to describe it as one thing):
* Bulletproof COO AI is a done-for-you business operating system that studies your business for 1 to 2 weeks, then generates your strategic plan, delegation frameworks, meeting structures, and onboarding systems—plus the training and templates you need to implement it all immediately.
* Buyers walk away with a complete, customized operating system (VVMMOO, WAR meetings, delegation plans, onboarding docs) built specifically for their business, ready to use, and backed by 10+ years of proven methodology.
